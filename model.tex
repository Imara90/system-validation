We created a model for our bridge to account for the sequenced actions necessary to open and close the bridge in a safe manner. The model and its components are displayed in figure \ref{fig:model}.

Our model also includes several sensors that will validate the preconditions that are required for our chain of actions. These sensors and their concurring sequence of actions are displayed in figure \ref{fig:sequence}. Using this chain of actions the global set of requirement was made.
